# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)

# Existing suppressions
WARNING: Immunization/ex-immunization-1: Immunization.vaccineCode: No code provided, and a code should be provided from the value set 'CVX Vaccines Administered Vaccine Set' (http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1010.6|20210630)
INFORMATION: Condition/ex-condition-1: Condition.category[0]: Reference to draft CodeSystem http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/condition-category|0.5.0
WARNING: Condition/ex-condition-1: Condition.code.coding[0].code: Unknown Code '401.9' in the system 'http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-9-cm' version '2015' - note that the code system is labeled as a fragment, so the code may be valid in some other fragment


# ============================================================
# 1. EXPANSION AND VALIDATION WARNINGS
# ============================================================

# --- ValueSet Expansion Warnings ---
# Justification: These warnings are expected due to the size of some value sets
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed

# --- UCUM and CodeSystem Validation Warnings ---
# Justification: Human readable annotations in UCUM codes are acceptable for our implementation
UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {tablet} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked

# Justification: These codes are not in the value set, but are acceptable for our implementation
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'LOINC Diagnostic Report Codes' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/report-codes|4.0.1), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt#73620)

None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Patient relationship type' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/relatedperson-relationshiptype|4.0.1), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-RoleCode#RESPRSN)

# Justification: Intentional use of mixed display formats in value sets for demo purposes
This include has some concepts with displays and some without - check that this is what is intended
This SNOMED-CT based include has some concepts with semantic tags (FSN terms) and some without (preferred terms) - check that this is what is intended (examples for FSN: [Psychotherapist (occupation)] and examples for no FSN: [Mental health counselor])


# ============================================================
# 2. URL RESOLUTION WARNINGS
# ============================================================

# --- Example URL Resolution Warnings ---
# Justification: These are placeholder test URLs that intentionally don't resolve
URL value 'process.env.SUBSCRIPTION_ENDPOINT/fhir-subscription' does not resolve

# --- Demo Domain URL Resolution Warnings ---
# Justification: These are example URIs using the demo domain that aren't intended to resolve
URL value 'http://shift.github.io/demo/identifiers' does not resolve
URL value 'http://shift.github.io/demo/valueset-identifier' does not resolve
URL value 'http://shift.github.io/demo/careteam-identifier' does not resolve
URL value 'http://shift.github.io/demo/condition-identifier' does not resolve
URL value 'http://shift.github.io/demo/diagnosticreport-identifier' does not resolve
URL value 'http://shift.github.io/demo/medication-identifier' does not resolve
URL value 'http://shift.github.io/demo/medicationrequest-identifier' does not resolve
URL value 'http://shift.github.io/demo/observation-identifier' does not resolve
URL value 'http://shift.github.io/demo/identifier/mrn' does not resolve
URL value 'http://shift.github.io/demo/relatedperson-identifier' does not resolve

# --- Profile URL Resolution Warnings ---
# Justification: These profile references are defined within the IG and resolve during build time
URL value 'SensitiveMedicationRequestProfile' does not resolve
URL value 'SensitiveCareTeamProfile' does not resolve
URL value 'SensitiveConditionProfile' does not resolve
URL value 'SensitiveObservationProfile' does not resolve
URL value 'SensitiveMedicationProfile' does not resolve


# ============================================================
# 3. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE CONFIGURATION WARNINGS
# ============================================================

# --- SNOMED CT Configuration ---
# Justification: Known SNOMED CT edition issue for non-international realm in this IG
WARNING: IG: The IG is not for the international realm, and it uses SNOMED CT, so it should fix the SCT edition in the expansion parameters

# --- Dependency Version Warnings ---
# Justification: Using older version for compatibility with other dependencies
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#5.0.1 released on 2022-06-22, but the most recent appropriate version is 7.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# --- Deprecated Extension Usage ---
# Justification: Known deprecated extension usage that will be addressed in future updates
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated


# --- ValueSet Version Warnings ---
# Justification: Version pinning will be addressed in a future update

There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActSubstanceAdminSubstitutionCode'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2.0.0, 3.0.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActSubstanceAdminSubstitutionCode' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActSubstanceAdminSubstitutionCode|3.0.0'
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-SubstanceAdminSubstitutionReason'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2.0.0, 3.0.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-SubstanceAdminSubstitutionReason' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-SubstanceAdminSubstitutionReason|3.0.0'


# ============================================================
# 4. EXPRESSION AND VALIDATION WARNINGS
# ============================================================

# --- FHIRPath Expression Warnings ---
# Justification: These FHIRPath expressions function correctly in runtime despite validation warning
ctm-1: The type specified in ofType() is http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Practitioner which is not a possible candidate for the existing types () in the expression ofType(Practitioner).exists(). Check the paths and types to be sure this is what is intended

# --- Content Format Warnings ---
# Justification: Known whitespace issue that doesn't affect functionality
value should not start or finish with whitespace 'participation[typeCode=RTGT] '


# ============================================================
