The [SHIFT LEAP SLS GitHub](https://github.com/SHIFT-Task-Force/leap-sls) focuses solely on:

- Inspecting FHIR Bundle entries (e.g., Condition, Observation, MedicationStatement)
- Matching codes against internal rule sets for sensitive categories
- Applying meta.security labels directly to those FHIR resources
- Add tagging attribution to the LEAP SLS
  - extension-sec-label-basis = v3-ActCode#42CFRPart2
  - extension-sec-label-classifier = "LEAP+ Security Labeling Service"

There is no logic in the codebase for:

- Creating Provenance resources linking labeling actions to agents or timestamps via FHIR
- Emitting audit trails or logs as FHIR resources

Note that there are [example ValueSets of sensitive codes](artifacts.html#securitylabelingservices) included here, but they are included only as examples. Formal ValueSet building is being done in HL7 as part of the [HL7 Cross-Paradigm Sensitive Data and Sensitivity Flags Library and Guidance](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/CGP/pages/321160258/Cross-Paradigm+Sensitive+Data+and+Sensitivity+Flags+Library+and+Guidance).

- [All Sensitive Codes](ValueSet-ExampleSensitiveCodes.html)
- [Behavioral Health Codes (BH)](ValueSet-ExampleBehavioralHealthCodes.html)
- [Sexuality and Reproductive Health Codes (SEX)](ValueSet-ExampleSexualityAndReproductiveHealthCodes.html)
- [Substance Use Codes (SUD)](ValueSet-ExampleSubstanceUseCodes.html)
  - [Opioid Abuse Codes (SUD+opiod)](ValueSet-ExampleOpioidCodes.html)
  - [Hallucinogen Codes (SUD+hallucinogen)](ValueSet-ExampleHallucinogenCodes.html)

Note that "Normal" data are those that are none of these sensitive categories, otherwise known as "Medical" data.

Note the local codes are similar to those defined in this IG, but without the system specified
- local#hallucinogen "hallucinogen substance use"
- local#bh_substances "behavioural health related substances"
- local#opiod "opiod substance use"
