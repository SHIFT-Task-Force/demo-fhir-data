Note that there are [example ValueSets of sensitive codes](artifacts.html#3) included here, but they are included only as examples. Formal ValueSet building is being done in HL7 as part of the [HL7 Cross-Paradigm Sensitive Data and Sensitivity Flags Library and Guidance](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/CGP/pages/321160258/Cross-Paradigm+Sensitive+Data+and+Sensitivity+Flags+Library+and+Guidance) There are also [Profiles that use these ValueSets](artifacts.html#structures-resource-profiles) that are purely informative to guide understanding where the codes are found.
